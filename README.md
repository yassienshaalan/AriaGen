# AriaGen: Audio to Music AI Transformation

Welcome to AriaGen, an advanced audio-to-music transformation application that turns your simple hums into stylized musical compositions. Built with Python, AriaGen records your humming live through the microphone, applies AI-driven techniques to generate music in your chosen style, and outputs the creation as a high-quality WAV file. Supported music styles include jazz, pop, classical, and more, allowing for a personalized musical experience.

## Features

- **Custom Audio Input**: Record your humming or any simple melody directly through your system's microphone as input.
- **Diverse Music Styles**: Choose from a variety of music styles to transform your audio input into, such as jazz, pop, and classical.
- **AI-Powered Music Generation**: Leverage a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate music based on the recorded audio.
- **Automated File Management**: Automatically save both the original recording and the AI-generated music with timestamped filenames for easy tracking.
